# Hangman Game

## Before You Begin
1. Create a new folder in your prework repo called `Module-2_Assessment`
1. Inside your `Module-2_Assessment` folder, create an `index.html`.
1. While still in that folder, create a directory called `assets`.
1. `cd` your way into the `assets` folder, then make three additional folders: `javascript`, `css`, and `images`. 
1. In the `javascript` folder, make a file called `game.js`. Use the `src` attribut of the `script` tag to link to this file, rather than embedding the code directly into your HTML document. 
1. In the `css` folder, make a file called `reset.css`. Past into it the code from the Meyerweb reset stylesheet. If you opt to use Bootstrap instead of writing your own CSS, skip this step, and simply include a link to Bootstrap via CDN. 
1. In the `images` folder, save whatever images you plan on using. 
1. push the above changes to GitHub. 

## Word Guess Game Requirements
1. [Watch the Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-IJcC4tYFI&feature=youtu.be).
1. Choose a theme for your game. 
1. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type. 
1. Display the following on the page:
    1. Press any key to get started!
    1. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
        * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts `_ _ _ _ _ _ _ `
        * as the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _ _ a `
1. Number of guesses remaining: (#number of guesses remaining for the user)
1. Letters already guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`)
1. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user plays it. 

## A Few Tips
1. **IMPORTANT**: In order to pass this assessment, a functioning game matters more than a pretty one. Make sure you read through each requirement and have implemented each. We're focusing on game mechanics, not just on the look and feel of your app. 
1. Code your game one piece at a time! Code all of your apps one piece at a time. *Always code one piece at a time!*
1. Flowchart/pseudocode your program and break the app into tiny, manageable fragments. This will make the coding process much less frustrating and a vertible Mach number faster. Otherwise, you'll be chipping away at a giant chunk of abstraction for way too many hours. 
1. The ability to problem solve a large problem by treating it as a set of smaller ones is the hallmark of a strong programmer. Best start adapting this into your development routine now, to better prepare for your more complex future projects.
1. Remember:
    1. Split the whole program into many distinct, pseudocoded problems.
    1. Focus on one of the smaller problems and solve it.
    1. Only when you solve one problem should you then move onto your next problem.
1. When you encounter bugs (and we all do), `console.log` will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.
1. As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the Chrome DevTools Debugger.
1. Always commit your work and back it up with GitHub pushes. You don't want to lose hours of your work because you didn't push it to GitHub every half hour or so.
1. **Commit often.**

## Create a README.md
Add a README.md to your repository describing the project.
